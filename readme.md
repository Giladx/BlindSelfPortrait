# BlindSelfPortrait

This repository stores work from the interactive installation "Blind Self Portrait" by Matt Mets and Kyle McDonald. It's built with [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/) and makes heavy use of the following addons:

* [ofxFaceTracker](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker)
* [ofxCv](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv)

And relies on the [s3g library](https://github.com/makerbot/s3g/) for communicating with a headless makerbot in realtime.
